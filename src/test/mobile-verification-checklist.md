## Manual Testing Recommendations

To verify these optimizations manually:

1. **Device Testing**: Test on actual mobile devices, not just browser dev tools
2. **Touch Testing**: Verify all buttons and links are easily tappable
3. **Orientation Testing**: Rotate device and ensure layout adapts properly
4. **Zoom Testing**: Test with browser zoom at 150% and 200%
5. **Network Testing**: Test on slow connections to verify loading states
6. **Accessibility Testing**: Use screen reader to verify content is accessible

## Browser Support

These optimizations support:
- iOS Safari 12+
- Chrome Mobile 70+
- Firefox Mobile 68+
- Samsung Internet 10+
- Edge Mobile 79+

All features gracefully degrade on older browsers while maintaining core functionality.
